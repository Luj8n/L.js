# L.js

A little javascript library made for primarily animation.

I made L.js to learn and understand better javascript. L.js is really similar to p5.js, some function are the same, but overall, I made everything myself :).

### To include just the javascript put this in the head:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Luj8n/L.js@main/Vector2D.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Luj8n/L.js@main/general-functions.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Luj8n/L.js@main/canvas-functions.js"></script>
```
